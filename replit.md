## Commands

### User Commands
- `/start` - Show main menu with options to create listings, browse, view transactions
- `/deal @username` - Create a deal room with another user
  - Example: `/deal @john_doe`
  - Creates a supergroup "MM ROOM N" with admin approval link
  - Sends branded image notification to both parties

### How Deal Rooms Work
1. Initiator runs `/deal @counterparty_username`
2. Bot creates a supergroup named "MM ROOM [number]" (starting at 40)
3. Bot sends formatted message with branded image to initiator showing:
   - Deal room created confirmation
   - Join link (admin approval required)
   - List of participants (initiator and counterparty)
   - Security warning about DM links
4. Bot sends same notification with image to counterparty's DM
5. Counterparty approves the join request and becomes a member
6. Deal room is ready for discussion and agreement

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Telegram Bot Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
   - Message @BotFather
   - Create new bot with `/newbot`
   - Copy the bot token provided

### Environment Setup
The bot needs the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` secret to run. Once you provide it, the bot will:
1. Use the token to connect to Telegram API
2. Start polling for incoming messages
3. Be ready to create deal rooms and process transactions

### Running the Bot
1. Provide the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` when prompted
2. Start the "telegram-bot" workflow in Replit
3. Bot will connect when you see "Starting bot polling..." in logs

## Technical Details

### Deal Room Implementation
- Room counter starts at 40 and increments with each new deal room
- Naming format: "MM ROOM [number]" (MM = Escrow Marketplace)
- Supergroups created with auto-incrementing descriptions
- Bot promotes itself as admin with full message management rights
- Initiator gets full owner permissions
- Invite links use `creates_join_request=True` for secure admin approval
- All messages use HTML bold formatting
- Professional branded image included with each deal room notification

### Media Handling
- Deal room image (`deal_room_image.jpg`) sent with every deal room creation
- Image includes @room branding and "Deal Room Created" message
- Fallback to text-only if image unavailable
- Graceful error handling for missing media

### Error Handling
- If counterparty username doesn't exist, bot notifies initiator but room still created
- Graceful handling of Telegram API errors with user-friendly messages
- File not found errors handled with text fallback
- All errors logged for debugging
